            <h2>History of Abu Bakar As-Siddiq</h2>
                <li>
                    Abu Bakar As-Siddiq was born in 573 AD in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His real name was Abdullah ibn Uthman.
        
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was a close friend and companion of the Prophet Muhammad. They knew each other since their youth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Abu Bakar was the first adult male to accept Islam and was always supportive of Prophet Muhammad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was known for his wisdom and was often consulted by the Prophet Muhammad on important matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the migration to Medina (Hijrah), Abu Bakar accompanied the Prophet Muhammad and faced many hardships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, Abu Bakar was elected as the first Caliph of the Islamic community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    His caliphate lasted for about two years from 632 AD to 634 AD. During his rule, he consolidated the Muslim community and expanded the Islamic state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was known for his justice and piety. He set a high standard for future caliphs with his simple and righteous life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Abu Bakar passed away in 634 AD and was buried next to Prophet Muhammad in Medina.
